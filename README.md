## DSP Primitives in Python

The purpose of this 3DY4 lab is to develop the understanding of some basic digital signal processing (DSP) primitives used in Software DeÔ¨Åned Radios (SDRs) and implement them in Python. All the details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab1.pdf).

The start-up code is in the [model](model/) sub-folder. Both the in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due 14 hours before your next lab is scheduled.
